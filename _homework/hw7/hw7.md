Work out each of the following problems **by hand** and be sure to show your work.  Scan your written solutions and upload them as a **single** PDF.
Be sure to show your work!  Solutions without work will receive very little credit.

**Problem 1:**

Consider the linear system of equations

$$\begin{align}
2x_1 - 6x_3 &= 2-5x_2\\
4x_1 + 12   &= 8x_3\\
4x_2 + x_3  &= 11 + 2x_1
\end{align}$$

* (a) Write down the augmented matrix corresponding to this system of equations
* (b) Find a solution of the above system using row reduction of the augmented matrix **by hand**.  Your final matrix should be in row reduced echelon form.  Write down the specific values of $$x_1$$, $$x_2$$ and $$x_3$$ which solve this system.
* (c) In MATLAB, define a matrix $$A$$ whose value is equal to the augmented matrix.  Repeat the row reduction steps using the computer and verify that you got the same answer.  Do **not** use any built-in functions such as *rref()*.  Your final matrix should be in row reduced echelon form and should agree with what you found in part (b).

**Problem 2:**

Find the row reduced echelon form of each of the following matrices **by hand**.  

* (a)

$$A = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1  & -2 & 3\\
-3 &  4 & 5\\
-1 &  8 & 0
\end{array}\right]$$

* (b)

$$B = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
2  & -1 & 1 & 5\\
3  &  1 & 6 &-1\\
3  &  0 & 5 & 0
\end{array}\right]$$

* (c)

$$C = \left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
4 &-3 & 7 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]

**Problem 3:**

Find a solution for each one of the following linear systems of equations.  If the system has infinite solutions, give examples of two different solutions.  If the system is inconsistent, write one or two sentences explaining why.

* (a)

$$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
2x_1 + 4x_2 &=2\\
x_1 + 2x_2 &= 1
\end{array}\right.$$

* (b)

$$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
2x_1 + x_2 + 2x_3 &= 0\\
x_1 + x_2 + 3x_3 &= 1\\
3x_1 + 2x_2 + 5x_3 &= 3
\end{array}\right.$$

* (c)

$$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
2x_1 + 4x_2 + 6x_3 &= 2\\
x_1 + 2x_2 + 6x_3 &= 1\\
-3x_1-6x_2 - 9x_3 &=-3
\end{array}\right.$$


**Problem 4:**

* (a) Find the equation of a parabola which passes through the points $$(1,1)$$, $$(-1,2)$$, and $$(2,-1)$$.

* (b) A jar of change consists of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.  You know that the total number of coins in the jar is $$700$$.  Moreover, the number of pennies is equal to the number of nickels and dimes put together and there are three times as many pennies as there are quarters.  If the total monetary value of the jar is $$53$$ dollars, then how many of each type of coin are in the jar?

* (c) On a particularly busy day a catering business sold $$85$$ sandwiches, $$65$$ bags of chips, and $$210$$ cookies for a lunch event.  They observed that men each ate $$2$$ sandwiches, $$1$$ bag of chips, and $$4$$ cookies; women ate $$1$$ sandwich, $$1$$ bag of chips, and $$2$$ cookies; kids ate half a sandwich, a bag of chips, and $$3$$ cookies.  Determine precisely how many men, women, and children the catering business fed that day.
