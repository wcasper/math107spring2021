## Problem 6

For this problem, consider the matrix

$$Q = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
  8 &  6 & 7\\
  5 &  3 & 0\\
  9 &  x & \heartsuit\\
  f &  1 & 43\\
 \Delta & z &  \clubsuit
\end{array}\right)$$

a) Write down the values of $$L(5,1)$$, $$L(3,3)$$, and $$L(2,3)$$.  Be sure to specify which is which.

b) Write down an MATLAB expression which will create the $$3\times 2$$ submatrix of $$L$$ obtained by deleting the middle row and the middle column

c) Write down the value of the matrix $$L(1:2:end,1:end)$$
