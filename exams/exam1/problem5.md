## Problem 5

On one particular trip, the velocity of a car at time $$t$$ is given by

$$\text{velocity at $t$} = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
0 & t \leq 0\\
10t & 0 < t\leq 6\\
60  & 60 6< t\leq 10\\
160-10t & 10 < t \leq 16\\
0 & t>16
\end{array}\right.$$


a) Create a function called *car_velocity* which takes in the time *t* and returns the velocity of the car at that particular time.  Make sure to include appropriate documentation!

b) Submit your function online and also include a copy of the file *car_velocity.m* with the rest of your submission files.
