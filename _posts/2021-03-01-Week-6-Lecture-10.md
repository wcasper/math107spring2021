## Today's Objectives

* Practice for midterm exam
* Edge detection

## Reading assignments

* When Life Is Linear: Sec. 5.1-5.3 (6 pages)

## Edge Detection

**The problem:** have the computer help us figure out where edges occur in an image.

**Applications:**
* self-driving cars
* identifying fractures in X-rays
* fingerprinting

**Strategy:** edges will occur where there are sudden changes to pixel values.

Consider the following figure

![image of a road](/math107spring2021/extras/img/road.jpg)

We can plot the grayscale values of the pixels on a several horizontal line through the image using MATLAB

```Matlab
A = imread("road.jpg");
Agray = rgb2gray(A);
hold on
plot(Agray(110,:))
plot(Agray(210,:))
plot(Agray(310,:))
xlabel("pixel")
ylabel("grayscale")
legend("row=110","row=210","row=310")
title("Detecting Edges by Plotting")
```

We can use differences of neighboring pixels to detect where the edges exist.

```Matlab
grayrow = Agray(110,:);
graydiff = grayrow;
graydiff(1:end-1) = graydiff(1:end-1)-graydiff(2:end);
plot(graydiff)
xlabel("pixel")
ylabel("grayscale")
title("Neighboring Pixel Differences for row=110")
```

We can also explore the whole image at the same time.
```Matlab
xdiff = A;
xdiff(1:end-1,:,:) = xdiff(1:end-1,:,:)-xdiff(2:end,:,:);
ydiff(:,1:end-1,:) = ydiff(:,1:end-1,:)-ydiff(:,2:end,:);
cdiff = xdiff + ydiff;
imshow(cdiff)
title("Combined x and y Pixel Differences")
```
