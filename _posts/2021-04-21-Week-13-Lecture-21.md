## Least-squares fitting

In many situations, we are tasked with finding the "best possible" solution of an **overdetermined** linear system of equations

$$A\vec x = \vec y$$

where here $$A$$ has many more columns than $$\vec x$$, so that there are many more conditions being imposed than there are variables.
In such a case, typically the system is inconsistent and there is no solution.  However, we can try to get as close as possible, ie. try to find a value $$\vec x$$ such that the vector norm of $$A\vec x - \vec y$$ is as small as possible.

**Theorem:** A value of $$\vec x$$ minimizing the magnitude of the error $$A\vec x-\vec y$$ is given by solving the system of equations

$$A^TA\vec x = A^T\vec y.$$

Furthermore, this latter system of equations is always consistent.

## Applications

* Polynomial curve fitting
* Exponential curve fitting
* Linear regression
* and many more!
