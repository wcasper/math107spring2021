##Install MATLAB

In this course, we will use a computer to perform otherwise difficult mathematical computations.Â  There are numerous popular tools that we could potentially use, including full-featured scripting languages like Python and R.Â  However, in this class we will exclusively use MATLAB, a piece of software designed specifically for the numerical linear algebra computations that we will perform.Â  MATLAB is pretty expensive, but lucky for us you can get a license for free when you are enrolled as a student at CSUF!

To install your own copy of MATLAB, follow the instructions here <a target="_parent" href="">
