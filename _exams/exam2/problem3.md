## Problem 3

The **symmetric component** of an $$n\times n$$ matrix $$A$$ is the matrix $$B$$ whose $$(j,k)$$'th entry is given by

$$B(j,k) = \frac{1}{2}A(j,k) + \frac{1}{2}A(k,j).$$

Create a function called *symMAT(A)* which takes in an $$n\times n$$ matrix $$A$$ and returns the symmetric component $$B$$ of $$A$$.

Be sure to carefully document your function.  Input your function into MATLAB
grader below and also include a copy in the additional uploads part of the
exam.
