## Problem 2

The $$n$$'th *truncated Weierstrass factorization* of $$\sin(\pi x)$$ is given by

$$T_n(x) = \pi x \left(1-\left({x}{1}\right)\right)^2\left(1-\left({x}{2}\right)\right)^2\left(1-\left({x}{3}\right)\right)^2\dots\left(1-\left({x}{n}\right)\right)^2$$

Create a function called *sinWeirstrass(x,n)* which takes in a number $$x$$ and an integer $$n$$ and returns $$T_n(x)$$ according to the equation above.  Be sure to carefully document your function.  Input your function into MATLAB grader below and also include a copy in the additional uploads part of the exam.
