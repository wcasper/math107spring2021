## Problem 3

The *sinc* function is defined by

$$\text{sinc}(x)  = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}.$$

Create a script (not a function!) that makes a plot of $$\text{sinc}(x)$$ for $$-2\pi\leq x \leq 2\pi$$ using $$1000$$ equally spaced sample points.
The plot should use a solid blue curve.
On the same graph, include a plot of $$1/x$$ using the same $$1000$$ sample points, but with a dashed red curve.
Label the $$x$$-axis as $$x$$ and the $$y$$-axis as $$y$$.
Make the figure title ``The Sinc Function".
Add a legend to the image.
Include a copy of your script in the additional uploads section of the exam.
